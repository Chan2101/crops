Crop Disease Risk Prediction

This project develops machine learning models to predict crop disease risk (fungal infections, etc.) using environmental data such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil conditions.

Project Objective  
To build supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) that assess disease outbreak risk under different environmental factors. The project also analyzes feature importance to identify key drivers of disease risk.

Files  
- `crop_disease_experiments.py`: Main Python script for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance.  
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
